<p>This is a reboot/spinoff of <a href="https://github.com/familysearch-devnet/python-fs-stack">https://github.com/familysearch-devnet/python-fs-stack</a>.</p>

<p>It is unfinished, but most of the functions have been instated. That being said, the working functions <em>shouldn't</em> have their names or expected outputs changed, but because this is almost public alpha, there are no guarantees.</p>

<p>It is designed for Python 3 and 2.7. Python 2.6 is the earliest supported version, but bugfixes are low-priority. 2.5 and earlier are not guaranteed to work, or supported, and are considered legacy.</p>
