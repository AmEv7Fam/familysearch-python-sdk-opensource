This is a reboot/spinoff of https://github.com/familysearch-devnet/python-fs-stack.

May or may not have all of the latest FamilySearch endpoints in place, but it is flexible enough to allow for additional endpoints

It is designed for Python 3 and 2.7. Python 2.6 is the earliest supported version, but bugfixes are low-priority. 2.5 and earlier are not guaranteed to work, or supported, and are considered legacy.
