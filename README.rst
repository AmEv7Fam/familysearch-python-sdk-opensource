This is a reboot/spinoff of https://github.com/familysearch-devnet/python-fs-stack.

It is unfinished, but most of the functions have been instated. That being said, the working functions *shouldn't* have their names or expected outputs changed, but because this is in public beta, there are no guarantees.

It is designed for Python 3 and 2.7. Python 2.6 is the earliest supported version, but bugfixes are low-priority. 2.5 and earlier are not guaranteed to work, or supported, and are considered legacy.
