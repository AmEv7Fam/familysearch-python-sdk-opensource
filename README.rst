This is a reboot/spinoff of https://github.com/familysearch-devnet/python-fs-stack which was last updated about June 8, 2011.

This is a fork of https://github.com/AmEv7Fam/familysearch-python-sdk-opensource which was last updated about July 21, 2015.

May or may not have all of the latest FamilySearch endpoints in place, but it is flexible enough to allow for additional endpoints

It is designed for Python 3 and 2.7. Python 2.6 is the earliest supported version, but bugfixes are low-priority. 2.5 and earlier are not guaranteed to work, or supported, and are considered legacy.
