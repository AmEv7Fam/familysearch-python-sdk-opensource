{"name":"FamilySearch Python SDK","tagline":"WIP Python SDK for FamilySearch","body":"## So, you want to know how to use this SDK?\r\nHere is some sample documentation for basic usage.\r\nThese sample lines should work from either the interactive interpreter or a script.\r\n\r\n\r\nInitial setup\r\n```Python\r\n>>> from familysearch import FamilySearch\r\n>>> app_key = \"MY-MAGIC-DEV-KEY-THAT-ALLOWS-FAMILY-SEARCH-ACCESS\" # You didn't think I'd give you a free one, now did you?\r\n>>> user_agent = \"MyApp/VersionNumber\"\r\n>>> fs_address = \"https://sandbox.familysearch.org\"\r\n>>> fs = Familysearch(user_agent, app_key, base=fs_address)\r\n```\r\nAs a side note: I left the FamilySearch base configurable so that, if there is a need to change it to, say, \"https://deployment.familysearch.org\" (which has happened for temporary sandbox upgrade), it is available.\r\n\r\n### Logging in\r\n\r\nDesktop login\r\n\r\nThe UN/PW login method is recommended for desktop clients, and is, in fact, required for certification.\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> try:\r\n...     input = raw_input\r\n... except:\r\n...     pass\r\n>>> from getpass import getpass\r\n>>> fs.login(input(\"Username: \"), getpass())\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
