That being said, the working functions _shouldn't_ have their names or expected outputs changed, but because this is almost public alpha, there are no guarantees.\r\n\r\nIt is designed for Python 3 and 2.7. Python 2.6 is the earliest supported version, but bugfixes are low-priority. 2.5 and earlier are not guaranteed to work, or supported, and are considered legacy.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
